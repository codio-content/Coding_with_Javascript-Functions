On the left is a simple example that shows a function `volumeCylinder()` that has 2 arguments.

It should be pretty obvious what is happening here. All it is doing it calculating the volume of a cylinder, using the formula

$
V = \pi * radius^2 * height
$

## Any number of arguments
So, a function can take as many arguments as it needs. The calling function will typically pass as many parameters as the function specifies arguments.
